# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

TODO app from Frontend Mentor challenge. I used DND-Kit to make it drag and drop on desktop - doesn't seem to work on mobile! This ain't the best work but I've spent quite a bit of time on it and am ready to move on. This is 1.0 as I'd like to go back and separate the filters into their own component so they look correct on mobile.
